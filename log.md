# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Basic HTML and HTML5 on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It's my first day join the challenge. My goal is to finish Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. I'm grateful that this first one is not too hard, since I am a bit familiar with HTML things from blogger/blogspot. 

### Day 2: April 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Trying create a tribute page with HTML that I've learned yesterday, using CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: First time coding in CodePen. Man, it's really fun. And what's more is, there are many people's work that's really inspired and motivated me to keep going on this. I hope someday I can be as skillful as them. 

### Day 3: April 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Basic CSS on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It was really hard since they're all new to me, but it's feel nice too for learn new things. I can't be expected to remember all concept of basic css that I've learned in only one day, though, until I really using them for building projects. So I think I would using it as soon as possible on tribute page that I've try to build yesterday. 

### Day 4: April 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Applied Visual Design in freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. I also learned from https://github.com/atapas/fork-me how to fork a repo and create a pull request in Github for my first time. 

**Thoughts**: I've recently started learning how to use Github, and it's a great feeling when I finally understand how to fork and pull a request. 

### Day 5: April 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Adding some CSS to my tribute page project on CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: I'm really having fun coding in codepen. Wish I had more time to do this. But fine, I'll do this again in the next day.

### Day 6: April 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to positioning an element with CSS, and also learning a bit of color theory from Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I've been a bit of struggled when learning how to positioning an element. Like, I'm still puzzling how to distinguish position: relative, and position: absolute. And this thought also come into my mind too: "When is the best time for us using margin, position, and padding?" Because they're all seems similar to me.
