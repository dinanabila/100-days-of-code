# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Basic HTML and HTML5 on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It's my first day join the challenge. My goal is to finish Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp. I'm grateful that this first one is not too hard, since I am a bit familiar with HTML things from blogger/blogspot. 

### Day 2: April 16, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Trying create a tribute page with HTML that I've learned yesterday, using CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: First time coding in CodePen. Man, it's really fun. And what's more is, there are many people's work that's really inspired and motivated me to keep going on this. I hope someday I can be as skillful as them. 

### Day 3: April 17, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Basic CSS on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: It was really hard since they're all new to me, but it's feel nice too for learn new things. I can't be expected to remember all concept of basic css that I've learned in only one day, though, until I really using them for building projects. So I think I would using it as soon as possible on tribute page that I've try to build yesterday. 

### Day 4: April 18, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learning Applied Visual Design in freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. I also learned from https://github.com/atapas/fork-me how to fork a repo and create a pull request in Github for my first time. 

**Thoughts**: I've recently started learning how to use Github, and it's a great feeling when I finally understand how to fork and pull a request. 

### Day 5: April 19, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Adding some CSS to my tribute page project on CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: I'm really having fun coding in codepen. Wish I had more time to do this. But fine, I'll do this again in the next day.

### Day 6: April 20, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learning how to positioning an element with CSS, and also learning a bit of color theory from Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I've been a bit of struggled when learning how to positioning an element. Like, I'm still puzzling how to distinguish position: relative, and position: absolute. And this thought also come into my mind too: "When is the best time for us using margin, position, and padding?" Because they're all seems similar to me. 

### Day 7: April 21, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the Applied Visual Design course on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Struggling a bit when learning how to make a heart shape with css pseudo classes after and before. But it's fine, I'm already get it now after doing a few of trial and error method. The one that still make me confused is the cubic-bezier part. How does it work? What kind of change that Y-axis does?  

### Day 8: April 22, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learning CSS flexbox and a little bit of CSS grid.

**Thoughts**: They're seems similar, so I've googling it - what is the difference between them. And after reading some of the articles, think I should try it for myself on CodePen tomorrow to understand the difference. 

### Day 9: April 23, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Creating NYAN WANTED POSTER page on CodePen. 

**Thoughts**: I'm creating this Nyan Wanted Poster for learning how to use CSS flexbox that I've learned yesterday.

### Day 10: April 24, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Learning CSS grid on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: Finally reaching the final lesson on Responsive Web Design course. I'm excited for waiting tomorrow, because that's my time for building projects :-)

### Day 11: April 25, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Start building a tribute page for Ki Hadjar Dewantara.

**Thoughts**:  It's a little disappointing on fact that there's a lot more of daydream than me typing the code. Next time maybe it's best to plan the layout first before starting to build. So there's not much wasted time when I code.

### Day 12: April 26, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continue building a tribute page for Ki Hadjar Dewantara.

**Thoughts**: 90% done. The rest is build the @media query part. It's a bit of stress when I building the page. Like, I always want to know, are there any ways that more simple to adjust @media css? I browsing it though, and what I get from article is, don't use absolute unit again. Use relative unit like em and rem, that would be better. Okay, I will do it in the next project then, and see how different it is.

### Day 13: April 27, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Nothing.

**Thoughts**: I need holiday. So today is my holiday from code. Time to rest my head.

### Day 14: April 28, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learning the benefit of using css viewport unit, and how it different from another unit like px, em, and percentage.

**Thoughts**: They say it's good and more effective for making a web responsive. If that so, should I not use px unit anymore?

### Day 15: April 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Start building a survey form for fcc project. 

**Thoughts**: The process is still on building the html and fulfilling the required user stories.
